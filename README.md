## Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global company layoff dataset to uncover critical workforce trends, funding patterns, and economic implications. The analysis was fully conducted using pure SQL, demonstrating the use of descriptive statistics, window functions, ranking operations, CTEs, and aggregations to derive actionable insights.
The goal is to showcase SQL’s ability to perform deep analytical exploration without relying on external tools — emphasizing efficiency, readability, and analytical rigor.

### Key Objectives

- Analyze total layoffs and funding patterns over time.
- Identify top industries, companies, and countries most impacted by layoffs.
- Examine monthly and yearly layoff trends.
- Evaluate cumulative layoffs using running totals.
- Detect patterns linking funding levels to layoffs.
- Rank worst-hit organizations and industries over time.

### Tools & Technologies

- SQL (```MySQL``` dialect)
- Window Functions ```(RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), SUM() OVER)```
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for structured multi-step analysis
- Aggregate Functions (```SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN```)
- Conditional Filtering and Grouping
- Date Extraction Functions (```YEAR(), MONTH()```)
